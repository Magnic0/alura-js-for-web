# JavaScript for Web Development

This repo was created with the intention of learning about JavaScript and Web development, where can this language be useful and provide better dynamism to the apps.

# The project

The project consists in a single-page app where you can play sounds by clicking each button. Like a drum or a MIDI software. All the sounds, images, CSS and HTML was pre-made by the instructor and provided for this course, so my part of the project is just the JavaScript slice. I also binded the numpad keys to each one of the sounds, so you can use it as log as one of them is in focus.
